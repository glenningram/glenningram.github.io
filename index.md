## Mapping Sea Level Rise and Coastal Flooding

This project, undertaken at the University of Arizona School of Landscape Architecture and Planning, identified and mapped communities at risk of sea-level rise flooding. Cities at risk showed significant current flood hazards and a high population density. This map specifically looked at density in New York City and the FEMA 100-year floodplain. Mapping both of these pieces of data illustrated risk based on flood zones and high population. 

Design is an essential visual component of communication. Better design allows for more precise communication of data and greater accessibility. The intent of this project was to use bold color gradients and simple, clear labeling to convey the map theme - a correlation between population density and flooding. The hope being this map would be easy to understand, regardless of background or previous experience with flooding.

## Seventy Years of Canadian Wildfire

This project, commissioned by Eric Kennedy of York University, maps the entirety of the Candian National Fire Database fire point data. The map uses a hexagonal pattern to illustrate fire frequency for the entire country, spanning from 1950 to 2020. Each hexagon, representing 500sq kilometers, counts the number of fires that fell within. The map illustrates how topography, region, and climate are drivers of fire behavior.

This project intended to create a map where the story the data communicated was immediately evident. In this case, fire frequency. The map serves as both a learning tool and art.
