## Sea Level Rise and Coastal Flooding

This project, undertaken at the University of Arizona School of Landscape Architecture and Planning, identified and mapped communities at risk of sea-level rise flooding. Cities at risk showed significant current flood hazards and a high population density. This map specifically looked at density in New York City and the FEMA 100-year floodplain. Mapping both of these pieces of data illustrated risk based on flood zones and high population. 

Better map design allows for more precise communication of data and greater accessibility. The intent of this project was to use bold color gradients and simple, clear labeling to convey the map theme - a correlation between population density and flooding. The hope being this map would be easy to understand, regardless of background or previous experience with flooding.

This map won the 2021 Arizona Geographic Council Maps & Poster competition.

## Canadian Wildfire Frequency

This project, commissioned by Eric Kennedy of York University, maps the entirety of the Candian National Fire Database fire point data. The map uses a hexagonal pattern to illustrate fire frequency for Canada, spanning from 1950 to 2020. Each hexagon, representing 500sq kilometers, counts the number of fires that fell within the shape. The map illustrates how topography, region, and climate are drivers of fire behavior.

The map shaded relief was created in Blender 3D, and hexagons in ArcGIS Pro, and design in Adobe Illustrator. Data from Candian National Fire Database.
