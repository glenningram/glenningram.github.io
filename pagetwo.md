## Lubrecht Forest and Bandy Ranch

Lubrecht is a 28,000 acre research forest located in the Blackfoot River drainage, in northwest Montana. The creation of the Lubrecht map was a year long process, beginning with a partnership with the University of Montana remote sensing team. Drones were used to collect a highly detailed Lidar elevation model. Collaborating with researchers, data was collected to match local vegetation, timber, roads, and features. This data, combined with the Lidar elevation model, was used to create a detailed map.

A second map set was created of Bandy Ranch, a 3,600 acre working cattle ranch belonging to the university. As with the Lubrecht map, it is the product of Lidar elevation models, collected data, and field testing.
