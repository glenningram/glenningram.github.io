## Lubrecht Forest and Bandy Ranch

Lubrecht is a 28,000-acre research forest located in the Blackfoot River drainage in northwest Montana. The creation of the Lubrecht map was a year-long process, beginning with a partnership with the University of Montana remote sensing team. Drones were used to collect a highly detailed Lidar elevation model. Collaborating with researchers, data was collected to match local vegetation, timber, roads, and features. Combined with the Lidar elevation model, this data was used to create a detailed map.

A second map set was created of Bandy Ranch, a 3,600-acre working cattle ranch belonging to the university. As with the Lubrecht map, it is the product of Lidar elevation models, collected data, and field testing.
